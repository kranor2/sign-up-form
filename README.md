## Description

This is my first project within the Full Stack JavaScript course with The Odin Project. This project has been a solid refresher on many HTML/CSS skills that I reviewed in the Foundations Course and have used throughout my career in content strategy and marketing web design. This also challenged me to build further upon those skills by implementing CSS resets, using relative units in CSS, and more challenging and intricate layouts using Flexbox. Having been largely supported in many of these HTML/CSS concepts by the GUI-based layout/design tools in the content management systems I eventually transfer over to my clients, it feels good to refresh my knowledge and skill with the code side of these concepts.
